A super easy and super dirty way of running a java server

The quickest and dirtiest java webserver you've ever seen

Simple steps to get this baby running, also with these things "#" to explain what it does:

# Install java and dev tools that means both the JRE and the JDK and yeah, I mean I'm running ubuntu bash on windows soooooo
1. sudo apt-get install default-jre
2. sudo apt-get install default-jdk
# It helps with.... things
3. Pray the previous installs correctly
# Clone this baby
4. git clone https://github.com/ChillBroYo/java-webserver.git
# Get in this baby
5. cd java-webserver
# Compile this questionable code
6. javac Server.java
# Run this legendary code
7. java Server
# Watch it host magically
8. go to http://127.0.0.1:8080/ (I swear its there)
